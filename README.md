**Predictive Maintenance AI System
**Project Overview

`Unplanned machine failures in industrial processes lead to costly downtime, production delays, and resource wastage. The Predictive Maintenance AI System leverages machine learning to anticipate failures, identify failure types, and provide real-time actionable insights to minimize downtime, optimize maintenance, and extend machine lifespan.
`
**Key Features
**
`Failure Prediction: Detects potential machine failures before they occur.
Failure Classification: Identifies specific failure types (HDF, PWF, OSF, TWF, RNF).
Data-Driven Monitoring: Analyzes historical data (temperature, torque, speed, tool wear).
Condition-Based Maintenance: Replaces reactive and scheduled maintenance with intelligent scheduling.
Explainable AI: Uses SHAP to provide transparent, trustworthy predictions.
Early Alerts: Sends notifications to reduce downtime and prevent severe breakdowns.
Resource Optimization: Helps plan maintenance schedules and allocate resources efficiently.
User-Friendly Dashboard: Streamlit-based interface for real-time monitoring and insights.
